---------
Overview:
---------
This directory contains the signature files necessary to create any deliverable
generated from the jakartaee-tck repository.  Most deliverables will only include
a subset of the signature files stored in this directory.



------------------------
Sig File Naming Schemes:
------------------------
The signature files have the following naming scheme:
	<package_name>.sig_<version_id>
Where <package_name> is the name of the package who's signatures are in this
file, note this includes all sub-packages.  The <version_id> is a unique ID
used to denote one version of a package signature file from another (since
we now support changing APIs between Jakarta EE platform releases).  Typically,
the version ID should be the version ID of the technology that the package
belongs to. (eg.  jakarta.xml.soap.sig_2.0 are the signatures that apply to
the SOAP v2.0 technology)

----------------------------------
Which Sig Files Apply To Your TCK:
----------------------------------
All TCKs which contain public API's need to perform signature test verifications.
The names of the signature files used by a TCK is called out in the 
$TS_HOME/bin/sig-test.map file.  The sig-test.map file contains key-value pairs
where the key=package_name and value=version_id.  These key-value pairs
are used to satisfy our naming scheme of:    
    <package_name>.sig_<version_id>
